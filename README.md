# Alexis Lemus CIS-18A Project
 Repository holding my progress with the class project

I will be making a program that allows a customer to schedule an appointment for a mobile pet grooming business. The program will allow the customer to select a date on the calendar using the JDataPicker component (hopefully). After the date and time has been selected, the program will show ask the user to select their pet’s species and from there, it will display a list of checkboxes of the services available. After that the program will ask the user to enter some information such as pet name, address, and phone number.  Finally, the program will display the user’s selections and a button will appear to close the program.  Upon pushing of this button, the program will create a .txt file of the user’s appointment.
The strength of this program will be that it will be easier for a business owner to keep track of appointment requests made by customers. Weaknesses that will need to be improved upon in further iterations of this program is to store all appointments made and block out dates that have already been scheduled. Another thing that can be added is an admin mode that allows the business owner to amend data entered by the customer. 
The main target audience of this program will be the customers of the mobile pet grooming business.
